My project is a creative Java programÂ that applies and expands on the knowledge learned in the first part of the Advanced Programming course.

I've included the following concepts in this project:

The concept of object-oriented programming (abstraction, encapsulation, classes, and objects). I did not, however, use the concepts of abstract classes, inheritance, or polymorphism.
Regarding generic collections: I used an arrey list.
File manipulation (by reading from the fail path) and exception handling
